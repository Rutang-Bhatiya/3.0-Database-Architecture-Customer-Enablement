This role required strong **analytical judgment, communication skills, and ownership**.

All examples in this repository use **dummy data** to respect confidentiality.

- Acted as a bridge between **customers and internal technical teams**
- Explained complex database concepts in **business-friendly language**
- Ensured data integrity, hierarchy consistency, and long-term scalability
- Supported and led **new customer onboarding projects**

This role focused on **why data is structured a certain way**, not just how to query it.
